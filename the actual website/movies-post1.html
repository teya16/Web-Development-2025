    <p class="post-text">About 3 years ago, I came across the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels while I was browsing at a book fair. 
      I was debating if I should get this set, or a set of Goosebumps books, since I had never read that series either. 
      I ended up going with the former, and thus, I added another piece of media to talk about, 
      and although it was annoying that the ink on the pages stained my fingers while I read the novels, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p class="post-text">I watched Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World at school, the movie adaptation, outside, during a disproportionately long break, and even though there was a bunch of glare on my screen, and a rock wall isn’t exactly optimal seating to watch a movie, I really enjoyed the movie. 
        I had seen the odd clip here and there from the movie, like the garlic bread scene, in which Scott discovers that, yes, bread does make you fat, or the scene where Scott jumps out of a window to avoid talking to his (underage) “girlfriend”, Knives. 
        I always hesitated watching it before reading the original graphic novels, so now was the right time. </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="post-text">Right off the bat, this movie has the perfect cast. It’s truly as if the characters on the pages all sprung to life. Casting Michael Cera as Scott was the best move, and I could say that about every actor. 
          Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the perfect Ramona Flowers, she really captured the sort of non-chalant attitude Ramona has in the graphic novels. </p>
          
          <br>

          <p class="post-text">My favourites, besides Ramona, is Wallace Wells, Scott’s gay roommate (it’s really important that I mention that he’s gay), 
            played by one of my favourite actors of all time, Kieran Culkin, and Envy Adams, Scott’s rockstar ex-girlfriend, played by Brie Larson. 
            Again, I cannot emphasize how close they are to their graphic novel counterparts. 
            The dedication the actors had to these characters can be felt through the screen. It’s a really special moment when the entire cast is this good.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="post-text">Jumping into the direction of this movie, wow. Edgar Wright had a tough job on his hands, turning a graphic novel with a video game-like structure into a movie, 
              but boy did he make it work. The parts of the graphic novels that were made to play out like a video game translated VERY well. 
              I think by the time you get to the point where Ramona tells Scott that he has to defeat her seven evil exes if he wants to continue dating her, 
              you kind of accept that this movie might not be the most conventional, but Wright still had to deliver on the scenes not looking too out of place. 
              The one that always comes to mind is when Scott has to fight Roxie Richter (another favourite of mine, Mae Whitman shined for me playing her). 
              The choreography of the fight was stellar, and the lines delivered were golden. I mean, come on, Bi-furious? The movie should get 5 stars from everyone for that specific line.</p>

              <br>

              <p class="post-text">The graphic novels are quite sizeable in my opinion, so squeezing six volumes into a two hour movie definitely wasn’t the easiest job, but once more, 
                Wright proved that he could pull it off. Of course, the movie isn’t a one to one translation of the novels, but it’s very close. 
                Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is a movie everyone should watch, in my opinion. It’s better starting off with the graphic novels, but if reading, 
                or graphic novels aren’t your thing, the movie is accurate enough to the source material that I think it’s okay to just jump into it. </p>
