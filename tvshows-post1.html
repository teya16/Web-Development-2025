    <p class="post-text">I am the opposite of a business oriented person. The only thing I enjoy about having a job is the fact that I get paid. So when I started watching Succession, 
      I thought it was kind of boring. To me it was just guys in suits talking about wanting to ambush the CEO of a company because his son wanted it. 
      I decided to keep watching because Kieran Culkin’s character, Roman Roy, didn’t get enough air time in the first episode. That was both a good and bad decision.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p class="post-text">Succession follows the ups and downs of the Roy family, a family that’s thought to be based of the real life Murdoch family. The Roys, much like the Murdochs, 
        are FILTHY RICH. Their company (or more like, the father, Logan Roy’s company) owns several news outlets, production companies, studios, theme parks and even cruises. 
        They’re rude, out of touch, anything an evil rich person could be (maybe excluding Siobhan at the start, but she gets more into the family business later on) and yet, 
        I couldn’t help but feel bad for them. They are absolute malignant beings that I don’t wish to ever be around, but they are just the kids of a mean, 
        oligarchal man who likes kicking people to see if they’d come back to him. </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="post-text">Throughout the course of 4 seasons, you see 4 siblings destroy themselves completely for their father’s approval, ultimately ending in his death, 
          on the day of his oldest, and most neglected son’s wedding day. In the first season, it’s Kendall, falling back into his addiction and ultimately killing an 
          innocent teenager at Siobhan’s wedding in season 2. Roman was always kind of nutty, but his serious of irrational decisions to try and stay on his dad’s good side are painful to 
          witness, especially when he ends up firing Gerri. Siobhan slowly ends up working for her dad, something she heavily disapproved of in season 1. And Connor? He’s just there.</p>

          <p class="post-text">It was hard coming to terms with the fact that I did feel bad for these 4 rich kids who barely had to work a day in their lives. I know that sounds ridiculous, 
            but if people are in a certain tax bracket, I lose a bit of sympathy for them. The Roys, however, reflected something real that thousands of people go through,
             including me.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="post-text">A bad parent can completely wreck a family. In the Roy’s case, it was Logan. The tension in the room when family members don’t speak to each other is so thick it
               can be cut with a knife. Fear is exhibited through all of the children, most notably, in my opinion, through Roman. Constantly backpaddling as to not upset his father, 
               not knowing that even the right decision could upset him.</p>

              <br>

              <p class="post-text">Succession is a painful 4 seasons, but it’s worth it. It’s sucker-punch after sucker-punch, and it rarely ever ends the way you want it to. 
                If you want an inside scoop on how rich people and businessmen work, watch Succession now.</p>
