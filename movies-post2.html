    <p class="post-text">It was February of 2024, and I somehow still hadn’t jumped ship off Twitter. 
      A person I followed was telling everyone to watch a movie about a goth teen girl and her reanimated Victorian boyfriend, set in the 80s, called Lisa Frankenstein. 
      It released on February 9th in the States, so I knew I had to wait a bit for it to get here. 
      When it finally did show up at Embassy Cinemas, I didn’t go because no one would come with me. </p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p class="post-text">I’m a wuss when it comes to doing things by myself (I didn’t even watch The Monkey because everyone around me shot it down when I suggested it, and I will inevitably do the same with Sinners), 
        so the next best thing was watching it on a random day in either July or August (I forgot which month exactly, bad summer jobs give me memory loss), 
        at home, with a Lidl pizza and a giant cup filled to the top with iced tea, and of course, a shoddy internet connection. 
        I got ready to witness another movie written by Diablo Cody (writer of Jennifer’s Body) and Zelda Williams’ third go at directing a movie. </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="post-text">Instantly, I was hooked. The movie starts with the cutest animated sequence, giving us some insight about a man who died tragically of a broken heart, and a lightning strike. Soon, the movie focuses on Lisa (played by Kathryn Newton) 
          and her new family, after her mom was murdered, leaving behind Lisa and her dad. Lisa now has a sister named Taffy (played by Liza Soberano), 
          who generally treats her pretty well and tries her best to make Lisa comfortable, and a stepmom from hell. I really have to give Carla Gugino her flowers, 
          because she plays an insufferable step mom to a T. A serious of unfortunate events happen to our dear Lisa. 
          Spiked at a party, getting groped at said party, and later on, having to take care of a corpse that showed up at her house.</p>
          
          <br>
<img class="break-photo" src="Images/lisa-frankenstein-post.png" alt="Lisa and the Creature">


          
          <p class="post-text">This corpse, or The Creature, as he’s credited, is played by the one and only Cole Sprouse, hot-shot actor and really great at playing a reanimated corpse. 
            His physicality and undead whaling were amazingly hilarious. The Creature wildly misunderstands Lisa several times, and constantly gets friend-zoned by her, 
            and the visible disappointment that Cole Sprouse manages to convey really made me feel bad for The Creature, even though he’s a dusty, grimy, maggot-filled thing when he first shows 
            up. Kathryn Newton also has the very hard job of acting like a moody, dramatic, slightly non-verbal goth teenager and she nails it. 
            You can really feel the woes of a teenage girl through this movie. The movie turns into a quest of getting the corpse his missing body parts, an ear, a hand, 
            and an appendage downstairs. The ear is sourced from the evil stepmom, when The Creature hits her over the head with Lisa’s sewing machine, 
            the arm is sourced from the guy who groped Lisa at that party, coming off with a clean slice from an axe, and the appendage from Lisa’s crush, 
            Michael Trent, when Lisa catches him and her sister in the act. </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="post-text">The movie wraps up with Lisa and The Creature, now looking more alive, “getting together” (keeping this as PG as possible), 
              and her subsequently going up in flames in her sister’s faulty tanning bed, that she and The Creature were using to charge up his new body parts. 
              A solemn scene of Taffy and Lisa’s dad visiting her grave is shown, which then transitions to a young man reading a poem with a bandaged up girlfriend laying on his lap. 
              This couple is Lisa and The Creature (still unnamed). When the movie ended, I couldn’t understand why people didn’t gravitate towards it. It was released in a timely manner, 
              close to Valentine’s Day in the US, and I can’t gauge why international audiences also didn’t like it that much. It was only in theatres for about 4 weeks, 
              so that might explain a part of it. </p>

              <br>

              <p class="post-text">If you’re into weird romances, murder, the 80s, and have a particular affinity for magenta and teal, this movie is for you. 
                Please go watch it, I need everyone to know that Cole Sprouse played a really handsome corpse.</p>
