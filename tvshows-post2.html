    <p class="post-text">Dolls. I hardly ever gravitated towards them as a kid. I preferred animal toys like Littlest Pet Shop and My Little Pony. I started liking dolls, but way later in life. 
      I now own 13 Monster High dolls and 2 Ever After High dolls. I do remember liking a specific Barbie series, however, Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p class="post-text">I started watching this show when I was about 7 years old. I am now 18, and this is still one of my favourite animated shows. Compared to the other Barbie side projects
        , excluding Barbie (2023), this show sticks out because it’s incredibly absurd. The Barbie shows made after this are absolute FLOPS compared to Life in the Dreamhouse.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="post-text">Look, it’s a kids show, so there’s obviously no “intellectual” humour. There’s a fart joke in an episode and quite frankly, it’s hilarious. 
          It’s pink and pink in an unavoidable way. Despite being a simple kids show, originally uploaded to Youtube, is beloved by many, particularly in the attention depleting land of Tiktok.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p class="post-text">Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, while not fully succumbing to being totally absurd, also isn’t shy when it comes to accepting the fact that the premise is really 
            strange. Of course, it centres around Barbie, the doll with a million careers. Emphasis on doll, because this show does not try to convince the 
            drooling children that are watching the show that these are people. It has reality TV style confessional interviews, drama between the characters, 
            the usual stuff you’d find in a kids show, but with animated physicality that reminds you that they’re dolls, complete with sound effects. Besides the physicality, 
            the pets in the show also look like their real life toy counterparts, and whenever the characters have to cook or decorate, they simply hit a button. 
            In the episode in which Chelsea’s birthday party takes place, Stacy throws eggs, flour and milk into a bowl, still in their packaging, into an oven and a second later it comes back out as a 3-tiered cake. I love their efficiency.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="post-text">A recurring bit that the show has centres around the character Midge. Midge is old. Midge came out in the 60s and didn’t get many releases beyond her original 
              doll because she came out as a pregnant doll. Despite that, Life in the Dreamhouse reintroduces her to a new audience, and when she first appears, 
              she’s in black and white. Barbie has to colour her in with makeup. Besides this, she constantly says widely outdated things, and 
              generally treated as kind of an old person gag. But Midge is cool. I love Midge.</p>

              <br>

              <p class="post-text">Is this show for everyone? Well, no it’s mostly for children. But if you’re looking to reminisce on how good kids shows were before we got Youtube Kids slop, 
                Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse is a very good contender.</p>
